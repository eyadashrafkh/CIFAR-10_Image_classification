# CIFAR-10_Image_classification
Using PyTorch to train Artificial neural network-based image classifier. The dataset used is CIFAR-10

This repository contains a report and an IPython Notebook for building and evaluating Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and using transfer learning with pre-trained models for image classification.

## Files

The repository consists of the following files:

1. [report.pdf](report.pdf): This file is the report summarizing the project, including the objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the implementation details and evaluation metrics.

2. [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb): This file is an IPython Notebook containing the code for building and evaluating the models. It includes the implementation of an ANN with 3 hidden layers, as well as the usage of pre-trained models (VGG16, GoogleNet, and Resnet50) for transfer learning. The notebook provides step-by-step explanations and showcases the project's implementation details.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- Keras (version X.X.X)
- Other required dependencies, libraries, or packages as mentioned in the notebook.

## Usage

To use the files in this repository, follow the instructions below:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Open the [report.pdf](report.pdf) file to read the project's detailed report, including the ANN architecture, the transfer learning models used, and the evaluation metrics.

4. Open the [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) file using a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).

5. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the models' training, evaluation, and comparison. Note that you may need to modify certain sections of the code, such as file paths or hyperparameters, to suit your specific setup.

6. Use the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation metrics provided in the notebook to compare the performance of the ANN and the transfer learning models. Analyze the results and draw conclusions based on the findings.
